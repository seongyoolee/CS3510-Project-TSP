## Submitted Files
- tsp-3510.py

    Reads input .txt files, algorithm w/ associated methods and logic, processing time, and creates output .txt files
- output-tour.txt 

    Plain text file created by tsp-3510.py containing the cost of the computed TSP tour in the first line and the sequence of node-IDs in the second line.
- algorithm.pdf

    Document describing our algorithm design and the rationale/principles behind our approach 
- README.txt 

    general outline of student info and project components

## Runtime Instructions 
This project was built with Python-3. In the command line, run the program in the following format:

$: python3 tsp-3510.py <input-coordinates.txt> <output-tour.txt> <time>

<input-coordinates.txt>: the name of the text input file containing the set of nodes and pairwise distances

<output-tour.txt>: the name of the text file generated containing the cost of the computed TSP tour in the first line   
    and the sequence of node-IDs in the second line.

<time>: maximum number of seconds the program should run
